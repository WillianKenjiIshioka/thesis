# thesis
Thesis developed during my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering

In this thesis my professor and I used a 1D-CNN and a 2D-CNN algorithm  to make a Intelligent Fault Diagnosis System to identify mass imbalance fault in small scale wind turbines using voltage and current signals. In this thesis we achived a 100% accuracy with the 2D-CNN algorithm using 3 convolution layers.
